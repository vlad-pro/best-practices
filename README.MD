# Why?
Many great best practices floating around internet and many of then didn't provide RSS feed so I can't bookmark it via feedly. And even worse some link is manual hosting and wait for it expired then I decide to replicate them here.

```mermaid

    participant Dashboard
    participant MariaDB
    participant NetworkFolders
    participant User
    participant EmailService

    User->>Dashboard: Request Dashboard Form
    Dashboard->>MariaDB: Fetch HTML Containers
    MariaDB-->>Dashboard: Return HTML Containers
    Dashboard->>Dashboard: Build Dashboard with HTML Containers
    Dashboard-->>User: Serve Dashboard Form
    User->>NetworkFolders: Fetch Graphs for Dashboard Form
    NetworkFolders-->>User: Return Graphs
    User->>Dashboard: Submit Dashboard Form
    Dashboard->>Dashboard: Build Email with Dashboard Form
    Dashboard->>Email Recipient List: Send Built Email
```
